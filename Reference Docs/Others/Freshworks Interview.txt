[2:53 PM, 11/19/2020] Muthu Freshworks: Second round will be totally QA round to come up with different scenarios for a use case
[2:57 PM, 11/19/2020] Muthu Freshworks: 1st round -
Framework explanation - If we say we know different frameworks, then thye would ask for the differences
Selenium questions - usually we can explain easily.. example -They will ask us to tell the steps to automate a usecale(like zomato app), how different levels of user accessing it (like middleware, customer and hotel rep)
Mainly on xpath - They would ask you to share your screen and open a website and would give a scensrio to write cpath..
Programs - Mostly our daily coding challenge would help, also if we know different concepts to understand the problem they we can clear that..
API - different authentication(oauth is main), basic requests




1) for interseting bug, tests how good we are thinking. say like what you found and how you reported to community
2) ask right set of questions like webex scenario ask like need to explain entire flow or just a section or feature
3) ask permission to think through the scenario. if scenario is difficult ask for tip or help
4) first tell +ve scn, performance, then go to -ve scn, edge case (finally if required ask for hint)
