20) Given an array of positive integers, find the minimum length ascending subsequence such that after removing this subsequence from the array, the remaining array contains only unique integers. Only one subsequence will have the minimum length (no ties). If there is no such subsequence, return [-1].

Example
n = 7
arr = [2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3]
After removing the subsequence [1, 1, 3], the remaining array of distinct integers is [2, 3, 4, 1]. The subsequence [1, 1, 3] is the shortest ascending subsequence with this property, so it is returned.

25) Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.
Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.
Example 1:

Example 2:
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"

Algorithm: HashMap 

26) Given a string s that consists of only upper case letters, you can perform at most k operations on that string.
In one operation, you can choose any character of the string and change it to any other upper case character.
Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.
Example 1:
Input:
s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output:
4
Explanation:
Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
Example 2:
Input:
s = "AABABBA", k = 1

4
Explanation:
Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.

27) Given a string s and an integer k.
Return the maximum number of vowel letters [exact first match] in any substring of s with length k.

Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

31) Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not in the list of banned words. It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isn't banned, and that the answer is unique. Words in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of punctuation.  Words in the paragraph are not case sensitive. The answer is in lowercase.

Example:
Input: 
paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
banned = ["hit"]
Output: "ball"
Explanation: 
"hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
"ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), 
and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.

Note:
1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000.
0 <= banned.length <= 100.
1 <= banned[i].length <= 10.
The answer is unique, and written in lowercase (even if its occurrences in paragraph may have uppercase symbols, and even if it is a proper noun.)
paragraph only consists of letters, spaces, or the punctuation symbols !?',;.
There are no hyphens or hyphenated words.
Words only consist of letters, never apostrophes or other punctuation symbols.

32) Sort based on another String
Given one string ('abbceeeg') sort it based on another string ('egbca') 
Result will be: 'eeegbbca'
Do it less O[N2] => O[nlogn] => O[N]
String s1 ="abbceeeg";
String s2 = "egbca";
Lowercase Alphabets
No built sort functions !!

32) You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0

Constraints:
1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
All the characters of jewels are unique.

33) Given an array of integers arr, write a function that returns true if and only if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]

Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

36) Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.

Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.

Example 1:
Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i", "love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.

Example 2:
Input: ["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is", "is"], k = 4
Output: ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words

37) The set S originally contains numbers from 1 to n. But unfortunately, due to the data error, one of the numbers in the set got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.
Given an array nums representing the data status of this set after the error. Your task is to firstly find the number occurs twice and then find the number that is missing. Return them in the form of an array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]

38) Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
Example 3:
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
Note:
You may assume both s and t have the same length.

39) Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.
Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.
Example 1:
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
Example 2:
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Example 3:
Input: s = "bb"
Output: 2

40) Given an array of integers say nums and an integer say target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
example:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation:
nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, so we
return [0, 1].

41) Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.
