	 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
	 * 
	 * Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If
	 * the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
	 * 
	 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Example 1:
	 * 
	 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1] Output: 2 Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your
	 * function should return the index number 2.
